    I have many roles as I’m sure all of you do.  First and foremost, I am a wife and a mother of two.  I also strongly identify myself as a daughter, sister, auntie, and friend.  Waitressing can be loosely linked to my identity since that happens to be my day job; however, I at least love working at that unique restaurant.  If by chance you are incredibly curious about me, I have many loves in different fields of which include music, art, crafts, psychology, astronomy and philosophy along with many others that have escaped my mind at this moment.
